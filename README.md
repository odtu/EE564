# EE564 Design Projects

## Guidelines

- Have look at the topics below. You can find detailed information and specs in the subfolders.

- Fill in your preference to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/173FqykIj7HfWxBJXid-JUIKdqOeXsMr1O3MJ19IN08g/edit?usp=sharing)

- Create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com/), and let me know your username, so I can give you write access to this repo.

- Learn how to use Git and GitHub, you can also download a software to make things easier ([Source Tree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is recommended). Have a look at [this link](http://ozan.keysan.me/okst/), for further tips.

- You are supposed to have all your text, codes and figures in the GitHub folder from the very first day (see Grading). First, create a sub-folder (named as your name) under the relevant topic folder. For example, `HVDC->Ahmet`. Put all your files under this folder. You are encouraged to have a look at other people's work.

- Your reports has to be [reproducible](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) (i.e. it has to include codes, equations and results). For text you can use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), just rename a text file as `.md` (this file itself is a markdown file).

-  However, if you want to include your calculations, I strongly suggest [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which can be viewed [online](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). You can also use Mathematica, [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) or Matlab Report Generator, but not Microsoft Word. If you are convinced to use IPython, here are some useful links:

  - To use it in your computer and for a quick start on Python install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
  - Or use [Wakari](https://wakari.io), or [Sage](http://sagemath.blogspot.com.tr/2013/09/ipython-notebooks-in-cloud-with.html) to use it online, or let me know, so I can give you  access to my personal server. If you use Chrome, you can also install [this App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colaboratory-notebook/pianggobfjcgeihlmfhfgkfalopndooo).
  - [IPhyton Notebook basics](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/pycon13_ipython.ipynb),  [Wakari IPython Basics](https://wakari.io/gallery)
  - [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)

### Grading

- **Number of Commits:30%**: The number of edits of your project  files as seen from the [contributors list](https://github.com/odtu/ee564/graphs/contributors). For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you'll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you'll get full credit. The project topics are not easy, so this is a way to encourage to start early and work regularly.

- **Level of Information:50%**: The detail level of your designs (see requirements above), and the accuracy of your calculations.

- **Report Quality:20%**: Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.
