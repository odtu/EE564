# Tesla Model S Motor

Design the induction motor that is used in [Tesla Model S](http://www.teslamotors.com/models), which has a few different variations. To keep things simple, use the [RWD 85 Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S#Powertrain), with rear wheel drive, which has the following specs:

- Max. Power: 360 hp (270 kW)
- Max. Torque: 441 Nm
- Top Speed: 225 km/h 

You can find some specs of the motor from [here](http://teslatap.com/undocumented/) and [here](http://my.teslamotors.com/it_IT/forum/forums/tesla-model-s-motor-output), you can find more information on the internet.
